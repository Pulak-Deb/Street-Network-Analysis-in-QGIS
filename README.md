# Street Network Analysis for Connectivity, Cyclomatic Number, and Average Distance

This repository contains a series of tools for performing **network analysis** on street networks, focusing on **connectivity**, **cyclomatic number**, and **average distance** calculations. These tools were implemented using **QGIS** for spatial data manipulation.

## Features

- **Connectivity Analysis**: Calculates the degree of connectivity of each node in the street network.
- **Cyclomatic Number**: Calculates the cyclomatic complexity of the network, which represents the number of independent cycles.
- **Average Distance**: Computes the average number of edges between all pairs of nodes in the network, providing insights into the networkâ€™s spread.

## Requirements

- **QGIS**: This project uses QGIS for network visualization and analysis. You can download QGIS [here](https://qgis.org).
  - `ORS tools`
  - `Open Street Map`
